# Entropy Maximization for Anomaly Detection in complex driving scenes using a UNet architecture

In this repository the code for my final project for the Algorithms for Big Data course at the University of Rhode Island is presented. 
The project is about anomaly detection in complex driving scenes using entropy maximization according to the paper [Entropy Maximization and Meta Classification for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Semantic Segmentation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chan_Entropy_Maximization_and_Meta_Classification_for_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_in_Semantic_ICCV_2021_paper.html?ref=https://githubhelp.com)
by Chan et al from ICCV 2021. This was my first Deep Learning project which is why the code is a litte unorganized, but I am working on refactoring it.
